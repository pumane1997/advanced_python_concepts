Problem: We need to build a cmd program that generates random diagonally opposite co-ordinates of 
the rectangle (user does not know). Next, it will ask user to guess co-ordinates inside the circle.

Objects needed:
- Function to generate random co-ordinates
- Input from user - guess co-ordinate
- Function to check if the guesses co-ordinate is correct

Ans from course:
- message -> string (pls enter some co-ordinates) -- inbuilt class
- co-ordinate -> float -- inbuilt class
- rectangle -> ? -- we have to create this class
- point -> float
