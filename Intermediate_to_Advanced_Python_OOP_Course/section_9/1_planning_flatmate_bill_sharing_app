1. You should not straight away start writing code 
2. First thing you should do is think about design of your application
3. Once you have design in your mind, you should object types, classes you need &
then add attributes and methods to it.
~ This is OOP way to make programs ~

How do you create design? -

1. Create an empty text file
2. Write title of program
3. Write description of what it does -> be as specific as you can
    - what it gets as input
    - what it returns as output
4. What Objects will you have
    - This is subjective but as general guide, if you have written a good description,
    look at the nouns.
    - Think and decide which ones should actually be objects, which ones should be attributes 
    of certain objects.
    - Think about what those objects 'DO' and come up with methods 
5. Start creating classes
    - based on design, create class with init method and other methods without code
    - Writing doc string is a good practice
    - write basic code after creating classes to demo how we will instansiate objects,
    just print out basic outputs.

    !! There are two ways to instansiate objects - 

    marry = Flatmate(name="Marry", days_in_house=25)
    john.pays(bill=the_bill)

    marry = Flatmate("Marry", 25)
    john.pays(the_bill)

    Both ways are correct, and it is up to the programmer's style whether to use one or the other, 
    but the first code has the advantage of being more readable because, for instance, it 
    immediately tells the reader that 25 is the number of days.

    It is recommended that, as a beginner, you do include argument names in calls so you can 
    understand your code better.
