Numeric Data Types in Python: Integers, Floats, and Complex

Integers: Integers are numbers without decimals.
Floats: Floats are numbers with decimals.
Complex: Complex numbers have a real part and an imaginary part denoted with j. 
        You can create complex numbers in Python with complex(). 
        The first argument will be the real part and the second argument will be the 
        imaginary part.

Strings 

They contain a sequence of characters and they are usually used to represent 
text in the code.

Quotes Within Strings
If we define a string with double quotes "", then we can use single quotes within 
the string. For example:
"I'm 20 years old"

String Indexing
We can use indices to access the characters of a string in our Python program. An index is an integer that represents a specific position in the string. They are associated to the character at that position.

This is a diagram of the string "Hello":

String:  H e l l o
Index:   0 1 2 3 4
