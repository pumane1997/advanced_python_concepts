Strings 

They contain a sequence of characters and they are usually used to represent 
text in the code.

Quotes Within Strings
If we define a string with double quotes "", then we can use single quotes within 
the string. For example:
"I'm 20 years old"

String Indexing
We can use indices to access the characters of a string in our Python program. An index is an integer that represents a specific position in the string. They are associated to the character at that position.

This is a diagram of the string "Hello":

String:  H e l l o
Index:   0 1 2 3 4
