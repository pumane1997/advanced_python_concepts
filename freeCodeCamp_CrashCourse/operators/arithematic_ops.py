Addition: +

When they are strings, this operator concatenates the strings and when they are Boolean values, 
it performs a particular operation.

In Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0. 
This is why the result is 1 + 0 = 1


Subtraction: -


Multiplication: *

Tip: you can "multiply" a string by an integer to repeat the string a given number of times.


Exponentiation: **


Division: /

Tip: this operator returns a float as the result, even if the decimal part is .0

If you try to divide by 0, you will get a ZeroDivisionError:


Integer Division: //

This operator returns an integer if the operands are integers. If they are floats, 
the result will be a float with .0 as the decimal part because it truncates the decimal part.


Modulo: %
