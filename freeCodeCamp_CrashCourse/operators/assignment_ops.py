Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable.

They are: =, +=, -=, *=, %=, /=, //=, **=

The = operator assigns the value to the variable.
The other operators perform an operation with the current value of the variable and the new value and assigns the result to the same variable.

Tips: these operators perform bitwise operations before assigning the result 
      to the variable: &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=.
