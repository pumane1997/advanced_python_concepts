These operators are:

Greater than: >
Greater than or equal to: >=
Less than: <
Less than or equal to: <=
Equal to: ==
Not Equal to: !=

These comparison operators make expressions that evaluate to either True or False.

Tip: notice that the comparison operator is == while the assignment operator is =. 
     Their effect is different. == returns True or False while = assigns a value to a variable.


Comparison Operator Chaining

In Python, we can use something called "comparison operator chaining" in which we chain the 
comparison operators to make more than one comparison more concisely.

For example, this checks if a is less than b and if b is less than c:

a < b < c
