Python objects

In Python, everything is an object. This means that every variable, function, 
class, or data structure you work with is an object.

All of them have type -> you can check with type(<object>)

    lets say,

    inty = 5    ... now looks very simple but actually is int(x=5)

Lets say you install some module/lib. If you run <module>.__file__ , then you will 
get the library path. If you go on that path and open it, you'll see all the code of it,
all the methods and so on. You'll realize that those are classes.


The objects int, list etc are also classes, these are designed by python team &
they are written in C python. C python is the software that we use to run python code
and all builtin objects are in C language (numpy as well) therefore we cannot view the 
code of inbuilt objects.

If you want to create any type of objects, you can design them using class keyword.

Tip: first design the objects/classes on paper, then in code
