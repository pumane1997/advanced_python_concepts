Creating a Class
This is the first exercise of a series of exercises during which you will 
practice classes and object-oriented programming.

In this series, let us suppose you have just been hired as a programmer at a 
company that sells paint for walls. The company gets visits from customers who 
want to paint their houses.

Your duty as a programmer is to create a program that calculates the number of paint 
buckets a customer needs to paint their wall area. To make this program, we will 
need to create a Paint class and a House class.

Let us take things step-by-step. Your task, for now, is to:

1. Create a House class which has an __init__ method.

2. The __init__ method should have a self and a wall_area parameter.
